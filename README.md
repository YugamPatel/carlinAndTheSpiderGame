OVERVIEW <br>

Carlin, the hero of our story, is going through an infinite number of halls looking for the light of
truth. This little champion (Carlin means little champion in Irish) faces a villainous giant spider in
each hall. The spider’s mission is to catch Carlin and trap her in its poisonous webs to avoid the
light of truth being revealed. Carlin tries to doge the spider and reach each hall’s door. But that’s
not all; Carlin is equipped with a specific ability too. She can make ice and freeze a particular
location of the hall. While she can only use her ability for a limited number of times, if Spider
touches the frozen surface of the hall path, it makes the spider much slower and buys more time
for Carlin to pass the hall(s).
